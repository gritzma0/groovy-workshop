## Groovy Workshop

In my opinion you only learn languages if you play with them. Only consuming PowerPoint presentations isn't enough.
So this workshop will allow you to learn Groovy syntax and concepts by making testcases pass. 

Please note that this workshop is heavily inspired by the [Groovy Koans](http://groovykoans.org/),
but provides a slightly different structure and scope.
